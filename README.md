## Learning objectives

- Write meaningful, semantically correct HTML
- Use modern positioning techniques using the `grid` or `flexbox` model
- Create a "pixel-perfect" integration from a given wireframe


## The mission

Welcome to your last project in plain CSS.

For this project, we will tackle a Frontend Mentor design.

You'll be led to use the knowledge you acquired on CSS (the basics, flex, grid and media queries) to do a perfectly responsive website.

The mission is simple, you have to perfectly reproduce this design : **[FIGMA FILE](FLEX-GRID-RESPONSIVE.fig)**

The graphic designer gave you all the elements so you can code the thing yourself.

Don't forget to check my general usefull tips.
